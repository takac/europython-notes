Numpy based on Numarray and before that Numeric
2005 release of NumPy

### Keys to success
- Hard work - especially upfront
- It will be lonely, especially when more complicated
- Do whats "right"

    - You will need others help
    - Listening to other people
    - Nuture empathy
- Patience
    - Good things take time

### NumPy
Basis as computations on arrays
NumPy arrays have to be same time
Array scalars
Vectorize your numpy
Array orientated computations
Hides for looping under the covers
APL father of array orientated computations

### Pandas
Structures of Arrays
Labels on dimensions (indexes)
Time series handling
Familiar

### Why Python for Technical Computing
Syntax gets out of your way
White space perserves visual real estate
Overloadable operators
complex numbers built in
